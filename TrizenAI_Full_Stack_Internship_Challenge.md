•

Responsive UI & Basic security practices

•

Cloud deployment

The application should appropriately handle scenarios such as:

•

A user attempting to access another event

•

A Team Member attempting to publish a gallery

•

A failed photo upload

•

An incorrect gallery PIN

•

Attempted access to unpublished photos

7. TECHNOLOGY STACK GUIDELINES

There is no mandatory technology stack. You may use any suitable combination of modern backend, frontend,

database, and cloud services (e.g., React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, GCP,

Docker, etc.).

Choose the technologies you are comfortable with and document your choices.

8. DEPLOYMENT & SUBMISSION DELIVERABLES

The application must be deployed and accessible online.

The submission must include:

•

Live application URL

•

Source code repository

•

Demo Admin credentials

•

Demo Team Member credentials

•

Do not commit secrets or credentials to Git.

9. DOCUMENTATION (README)

The repository must contain a README.md explaining:

•

Project overview & Technology stack

•

System Architecture & Database design

•

Local setup instructions & Environment variables

•

Deployment steps & Known limitations

A simple architecture diagram is encouraged.

10. TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Include basic tests for important functionality, especially:

•

Authentication and Authorization

•

Photo access controls

•

Gallery publishing workflows

•

PIN-protected access verification

11. OPTIONAL / BONUS FEATURES

If   time   permits,   you   may   implement   optional   features   such   as   image   thumbnails/resizing,   pagination/infinite

scrolling, photo search/filtering, bulk upload, photo downloading, gallery expiration, CDN usage, or automated

CI/CD pipelines.

Do not sacrifice core functionality for bonus features.

12. DEVELOPMENT & EVALUATION

You may use any tools, libraries, frameworks, or development approaches that help you build the application. You

should understand and be able to explain the code you submit.

During the evaluation, you may be asked to explain your architecture or make a small change to your application.

13. QUALITY CRITERIA & AREAS TO CONSIDER
